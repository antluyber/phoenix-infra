One or more AWS accounts to host broadly applicable security-oriented workloads and services, tools, and supporting data. Common examples of tools and services configured in this account include an Amazon GuardDuty master account, AWS Security Hub master account, Amazon Detective master account, and third party cloud security monitoring services and tools. Human access to these AWS accounts for administration purposes should be minimized, in favor of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and other automated techniques. Where thereâ€™s a need for direct human administration, authorized administrators require sufficient write access. Beyond administrative access, additional human access will likely be needed, so that security team members can interact with and potentially configure features of the security services.
